# machinelearning_printtoexcel

This repo contains the Skilearn based python scripts which will print the output into excel sheets. 

1. Multinomial Naive Bayes
2. Random Ensemble
3. Gradient Boosting

All above methods used from Scikitlearn library to find out the accuracy of given dataset and compare them against the output which it produced. Each python module used to print the outputs in seperate spreadsheets with the below names. 

* naive_bayes_final_predict.xlsx,
* random_ensemble_final_predict.xlsx,
* gradient_boosting_final_predict.xlsx files.

Addition to that, this modules will help us to find the Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score Values for each method is calculated in next sheet of corresponding spreadsheets.
