# machinelearning_printtoexcel

Here I have 3 methods in python,

Multinomial Naive Bayes
Random Ensemble
Gradient Boosting
Each methods used to print the outputs in separate spreadsheets in naive_bayes_final_predict.xlsx,random_ensemble_final_predict.xlsx,gradient_boosting_final_predict.xlsx files.

Accuracy,Precision,Recall,F1 score Values for each method is calculated in next sheet of corresponding spreadsheets.
